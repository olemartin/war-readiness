Pushes how ready the individual clan members are for the war.

The event json might look like this.

```
{
    "clan_id": "L2YC2VY",
    "discord_key": "454640565506801675/9o0CwefwefwefyzL21i85ZzUxTYJBv8zxl7JrFFBoJC6mRbUAGFHjcZB6BA8OM348XVvYB8o90hoz",
    "clan_league": "gold"
}
```

`clan_league` dictates how the sorting is done. If you say `gold` here, the members are sorted according to gold-league
